This is a first example implementation of a project result dashboard based on
the [en.dash](https://github.com/dlr-ve-esy/en.dash) framework. **en.dash**
provides an easy-to-use API for [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and provides
API elements for plots generated with the
[echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) plotting library.

## Example model results

The results shown in this dashboard are taken from REMix model developed in the
**FlexMex** project. The figures and description is taken from the respective
publications listed in the references tab, especially
[this article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112177).

FlexMex stands for Model experiment for the temporally and spatially resolved
investigation of future load balancing in the power system Within the MODEX i.e.
Modelling experiments for the Energy Transition (Modellexperimente f√ºr die
Energiewende in German), the FlexMex project invoked comparisons of nine energy
system models from different research institutions. The project was funded by
the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK),
formerly Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). All relevant
publications of data and reports are listed below. The scope and requirements of
FlexMex translate into a comprehensive model within the REMix framework. The
model components (commodities, converters, etc.) and the overall structure are
explained in the following.

### Modeling Scope

#### Spatial resolution

- 11 neighboring countries (Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Austria)

#### Temporal Scope

- Temporal Resolution: 1 hour
- Model Years: 2050

#### Technological scope and scenario overview
