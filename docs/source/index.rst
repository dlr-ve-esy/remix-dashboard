Welcome to en.dash's documentation!
===================================

en.dash is a framework based on streamlit for building data dashboards for energy system analysis data.
The goal of the framework is to reduce the amount of effort to create or modify a dashboard.
It offers tooling functions for design elements and exposes plotting functions for creating echarts based plots of data.


en.dash follows a data driven design, most features can be configured either by the dashboard_confi.json file or 
by supplying data for a given plot. The metadata description of the plot data is also available 
to make it easy to adapt one owns data to the plot functions available.

en.dash also supplys a very basic layout and example dashboard with its framework, to get users and designers
started without the requirement of first building a basic example by themselves.
